# LIP: Local Importance-based Pooling

PyTorch implementations of LIP (ICCV 2019).


This codebase is *under construction* and will contain:

- [x] the implementation of LIP based on PyTorch primitives,
- [x] LIP-ResNet,
- [ ] LIP-DenseNet,
- [x] ImageNet training and testing code,
- [ ] CUDA implementation of LIP.

## NEWS

[8.13] We uploaded the code of LIP-ResNets and their ImageNet pretrained models (LIP-ResNet-50 & 101).

## Dependencies
1. Python 3.6
2. PyTorch 1.0+
3. tensorboard and tensorboardX

## Pretrained Models
